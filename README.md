            <li>Close the player creation window.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>To create a tournament, you need to:
        <ol>
            <li>Click the "Create Tournament" button.</li>
            <li>In the new window that opens, fill in the fields:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>"Name of the game"</strong> - the name of the game for which the tournament will be held.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Tournament name"</strong> - the name of the tournament is required.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Date"</strong> - the start date of the tournament or the date of the event.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Prize money"</strong> - prize pool, you can enter both money and items. If there is no prize pool, you can leave the field blank or write "$0".</li>
                    <li><strong>"Best of the group stage"</strong> - this is a format in which matches in the group stage of the tournament are held until a certain number of victories. For example, if the "Best of 3" format is used, the match continues until one of the participants wins two victories.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Best of the playoffs"</strong> - this is a similar format but applies to matches in the playoff stage of the tournament. To advance further in the tournament, a team or player must win a certain number of matches in the series.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Best of the playoffs final"</strong> - this is the format for the final match in the playoff stage. In the final, participants must win a certain number of games in the series to become champions. For example, if it is "Best of 5", the final continues until one of the participants wins three games.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The final step will be the selection of participants. To do this, click the plus sign on the right to include the player in the tournament. If you click the plus sign again, it will cancel their participation in the tournament. There must be 4, 8, 16, 32 players to participate, and so on.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>We are done with creating the tournament. Find your tournament in the list of tournaments and click on it.</li>
    <li>A window will open, where the tournament information is shown on the left, and the main field of all actions is in the center. When starting, you will first see the players of the group stage.</li>
    <li>Above the main field, there are tabs:
        <ol>
            <li><strong>"Group"</strong> - group stage.</li>
								<ol>
										<li><strong>"Group list"</strong>- here the result of the group stage is shown, that is, if the player is green, then he went to the Playoff, if red, then he was eliminated from the tournament, and if white, then the group stage is still ongoing for these players.</li>
										<li><strong>"Round #"</strong>- all the matches of the group stage are shown here, divided into rounds. To give a player one point, you just need to click on the number with the left mouse button, and to take it - with the right.</li>
								</ol>
            <li><strong>"Play-off"</strong> - tournament bracket.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>


<h2>Other</h2>
<h5>Will there be updates that will improve the visuals and fix bugs?</h5>
<p>- Yes, I will definitely take care to visually improve the interface and fix all the bugs in future versions. </p>

<h5>Why is this program better than its analogues?</h5>
<p>- At first glance, the program may not seem beautiful, and also not very functional, which is why it loses to most programs of the same theme, but the most important thing is that it fulfills its functions 100%, namely, it simplifies the creation and holding of tournaments. </p>

<h5>What does the "Strategist" in the title mean?</h5>
<p>- Initially, the program was planned so that my friends and I could make a tournament in strategy games, hence its name - “Strategist”.</p>
